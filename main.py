The game should be from the perspective of office colleagues rather than a compliance officer. The objective is to teach players about the impact of financial crimes and how people may unknowingly violate regulations.
Here are the details:
1. Setting: The game is set in a modern corporate office of a company called Crestfield Industries, known for its innovative products.
2. Player Character: The player is Alex, a diligent office employee.
3. Gameplay Elements:
- Exploration: Players navigate through various office locations such as meeting rooms, break rooms, the finance department, and personal workspaces.
- Interaction: Players interact with different colleagues, including the helpful finance officer, the overly ambitious project manager, and other office staff, each providing clues or misleading information.
- Decision-Making: Players make choices during conversations and tasks that affect the game's outcome.
- Discovery: Players uncover hidden documents, suspicious transactions, and covert communications.
4. Key Scenarios:
- The Expense Report: A colleague submits a suspiciously high expense report. Players must decide whether to approve it, ask for clarification, or report it.
- The Vendor Contract: During a meeting, a senior manager insists on choosing a specific vendor despite higher costs. Players must decide whether to agree, raise concerns, or investigate the vendor.
- The Gift Offer: Players receive an expensive gift from a potential client before a major contract decision. They must decide whether to accept it, decline politely, or report the offer.
5. Learning Objectives:
- Understand various forms of financial crimes within a corporation.
- Recognize signs and red flags of financial misconduct.
- Learn the importance of ethical decision-making and potential consequences.
- Develop strategies for reporting and addressing suspected financial crimes.
6. Ending: The game concludes with a summary of decisions and their impact on the company, highlighting key learnings and providing tips for real-world application.
Using this prompt, please create a detailed Zork-like text adventure game script, including dialogue, decision points, and descriptions of scenarios.
            REALLY IMPORTANT!!! Do not play out the scenario yourself. Start the game for the user to play!""")
